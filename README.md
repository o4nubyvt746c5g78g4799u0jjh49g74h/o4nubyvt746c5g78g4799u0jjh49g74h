"I want to make it clear that I do not condone cheating in any form. My posts and repositories are created with the intention of enhancing the gaming experience, promoting fair play, and supporting the gaming community. I believe in fostering a healthy, enjoyable environment for all players, and my work is focused on making games better through legitimate means. Cheating undermines the spirit of gaming, and I encourage everyone to play with integrity and respect for others."

Please note that I do not post my main sources or applications (.exe files) directly to my repositories. Instead, I share content that is generally of interest to the community or things that people commonly look for. If you're seeking a specific application that is not publicly available or if you're looking for an unreleased version, feel free to reach out to me directly. You can contact me through my Discord for any private or unshared applications (My Discord id is Above).
